This code finds strong crescent configurations in the Euclidean norm by searching a triangular lattice using a backtracking algorithm. It is written in Python. I used this 1) to provide constructions of strong crescent configurations of sizes n <= 6 and 2) to prove that any strong crescent configuration of size n >= 7 cannot lie in a fairly large triangular lattice. This is described in greater detail in my group's paper (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08769.pdf).
